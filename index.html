Online menus with photos of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both the studnets and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member that accesses the canteen could be provided with a "School Canteen Account" on the online website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and dietary requirments they may have. Ordering online by checking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for students and staff alike. Here again, diversity is key.</p>

        1. Accuracy 
        Humans are prone to error, even when we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
        management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual
        data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payfell data.
  
        2. Economics
        Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves by putting an end
        to inaccurate tiem reporting, buddy punching, absence, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter
        of fact, a study done by the Assium Group found that larger organizations save up to $1,600 per employee
        after implementing automated attendance management systems.
        
        3. Performance/Efficiency
        Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be time consuming, laborius, and expensive affair. It takes
        time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll
        manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated attendance management system, that does it 
        all for you, from keeping track of employees hours to automatically importing information into your payroll
        system. The time and saved combined with data accuracy helps optimizing the use of resources while lead to
        increases productivity and improved profits. And many more like Visibility/Insights, Hassle free Workflow 
        Management, Flexability, Integration/Configuration, Meal Time tracking, Security, and Compillance.
